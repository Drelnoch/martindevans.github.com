## TL;DR

I'm in Japan, Kyoto, the ancient capital of Japan.

## Kyoto

Kyoto was the home of the emperor and the capital of Japan from 794 through to 1868. It's a city absolutely *packed* with history - there are no less than **17** UNESCO World Heritage sites in the city!

Of course we also visited the two most important cultural sites in Kyoto:

Whilst in Kyoto we stayed in a Japanese style _Ryokan_ - with tatami mats on the floor and futons to sleep on.

We were in Kyoto for an entire week and took _loads_ more pictures of many more places but I only wanted an overview here instead of an entire gallery! I might whip up a full blown gallery once I'm back in the UK and have a bit more time.

## Next...

I'm actually writing this in Hiroshima, which we arrived in two days ago. We'll be departing for Nagoya tomorrow (just for one night) and so I'll probably do a combined Hiroshima/Nagoya post next.
