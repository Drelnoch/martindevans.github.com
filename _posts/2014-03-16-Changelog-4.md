## TL;DR

Another changelog is out. I've tested and polished the interactivity system, allowing entities to be "used" by the player.

## Under The Hood - Using Objects

The interactivity system is really very simple, actually it's so simple I almost decided not to write this section! The player character has an *ItemUser* behaviour attached to it which listens for *UseKeyPressed* events from the input system. When the behaviour receives an event it projects a short ray into the world (out from the camera position) and finds out what entities it hits. For each entity it does two things:

1. If the entity has a behaviour which implements the IItemUsable interface then the *Use(EntityId user)* method is called on that behaviour.
2. A general event is broadcast indicating that entity A used entity B.

And that's really it. To make an object interactive you simply need to attach a behaviour implementing IItemUsable to the behaviour and you're sorted. Or if you want to listen to *other* entities being interacted with for some reason you can just listen for the event.
