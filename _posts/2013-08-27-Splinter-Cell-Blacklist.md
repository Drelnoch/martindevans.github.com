## TL;DR

I'm still playing the game, this is just a log of my first impressions - It will be tidied up into a proper analysis once I finish.

## First Impressions
 - Sticky cover (excellently done, can more or less arbitrarily move from cover to cover in one smooth motion).
 - "Optional" multiplayer (many missions can be done both co-op or solo).
 - "Unbalanced" multiplayer (In the sense that the two teams, spies and mercs, are very different).
 - Mission objectives and hints written into the world.
 - Very deadly enemies (being spotted usually results in almost instant death).
 - Very deadly players (I've killed almost all enemies with a single bullet to the head).
 - UPlay (sucks)
 - Control Hints (there are always tooltips in the world showing your options)
