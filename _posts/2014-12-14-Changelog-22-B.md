## TL;DR

Slow week thanks for other commitments. But I still got NPC vision frustums done.

## This Week

[Watch The Video!](http://youtu.be/wv6MgJxs4mI)

- NPC vision frustum
- Vision raycasting to determinate entity visibility
- NPC tool interface to allow NPCs to use tools (such as guns)

## What's Next?

I'm working towards an NPC which will simply wander around and shoot people on sight, I had hoped to get that done this week but as I said I had a lot of other commitments this week - hopefully next week I can get back on track! After that I'm going to be running a multiplayer deathmatch for some of my friends - this will be a good test for multiplayer games with NPCs in, but will also just be great fun!
