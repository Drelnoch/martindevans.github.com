## TL;DR

<del>I wrote up and recorded a changelog but unfortunately some complicated technical problems (inexplicable build failures) have popped up. Hopefully I'll get the changelog out tomorrow!</del>

New video is out (one day late) introducing navmesh generation.

## Inexplicable Build Failures

Epimetheus/Heist is a complex set of over 40 interdependent projects. Somewhere along the way one of these projects have output some incorrect artefacts and that's messing everything up which means I can't record the game for the changelog! These kinds of problems are incredibly difficult to debug and so I can't rely on getting them fixed in a timely enough manner today to also get a video recorded, edited and uploaded. Hopefully I should get these issues fixed later today/early tomorrow and I can get a video out then.
