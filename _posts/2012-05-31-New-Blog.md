## TL;DR

My old blog sucked, this is my new one.

Booklink this: [martindevans.me](martindevans.me)
Or this, if you prefer: [martindevans.github.com](martindevans.github.com)

## You spoke, I listened

Earlier this week (on my old blog) I launched [the demo version](http://placeholder-software.co.uk/setup/heistgame/publish.htm) of heist, I [posted about](http://www.infinity-universe.com/Infinity/index.php?option=com_smf&Itemid=75&topic=16891.0) it on some forums I frequent and got some very positive feedback. Great!

There was just one piece of very negative feedback which everyone agreed upon: _Your blog SUCKS_. I built the site way back in the first year of university, a few of the problems I encountered:

- Appengine was new
- I'd never used python before
- I had no idea about client web development
- I had no idea about server side web development

Oddly enough this combination didn't come together to produce the fantastic, cutting edge site I expected. Over the years since then I've had a few goes at restructuring the site a little but the site really needs a total rebuild, the backend is a mess of spaghetti code and the front end is eye bleedingly ugly. It had to go.

## It had to go.

Luckily just as I got pushed into constructing a new blog by the complaints of the forumites I was experimenting with [github pages](http://pages.github.com/) for hosting documentation for Heist. Github pages are free hosting, don't required any backend coding, allow me to write my blog posts in [markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) and require essentially no work to set up. Sold!

So, here were are. My [old blog](martindevans.appspot.com) will stay up until I transfer across all the content, if that ever happens. But new content will appear here from now on.
