## TL;DR

I have a pretty fragile wrist (RSI problems) and it flared up very badly last week. No changelog :(

## Wai No Changelog?

I really wanted to get a changelog out this week, I've been working on a project called [Base-ArtificialIntelligence](https://bitbucket.org/martindevans/base-artificialintelligence) which builds higher level AI abstractions over the very low level things offered directly in the scripting interface. Most of my work has been building a behaviour tree which, when given a target, will generate and follow a path to that target (including regenerating the path when the target moves etc). I'm really excited to get an AI video out because AI is so core to a stealth game - I'm *hoping* to get a basic AI running around shooting people in a deathmatch within a week or two.

Unfortunately my wrist is in a [pretty fragile condition]({% post_url 2012-09-24-Full-Steam-Ahead %}) and it really flared up last week. I couldn't type by the end of the week and I spent most of Thursday and Friday watching anime, reading books and staring longingly at my computer wanting to work on AI!

## Not All Hope Is Lost

I have spent the last 4 days avoiding my computer as much as possible (watching a lot of [The International](http://www.dota2.com/international/overview/) and playing a lot of board games) and my I'm feeling like it's safe to get back to work now. I've decided to adopt the [Pomodoro Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) since that will force me to take frequent breaks and not overexert my wrist.

Unfortunately this all means that progress is going to be slower than usual as I have to take long breaks to let myself recover.

## TL;DR (2)

Don't let yourself develop RSI, especially if you're a software developer! It really *really* sucks and will have a crippling and long term impact on your ability to do your work. Know the warning signs and take action to stop it getting any worse - some wrist exercises (I have some little 1Kg dumbells which are good for wrist exercise) and a correct typing pose can completely prevent problems.
