## TL;DR

The first proper changelog is out, I talk about how multiplayer no longer sucks.

## What's Next?

I'm thinking about adding in some of the most basic elements of the actual Heist gamemode next, so we can pull off a (_extremely_) basic Heist - basically just loot entities to collect, an inventory system to put loot into, an escape point which ends the game and counts up how much loot your made off with. I'd also like to get a basic bank layout generator going, but I think that's probably a couple of weeks down the road yet.
