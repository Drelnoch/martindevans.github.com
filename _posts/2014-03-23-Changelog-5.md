## TL;DR

Another changelog is out. Showing off how the procedural generation system ties together hand designed parts with a procedural generation system.

## This week...

[**Watch The Video!**](http://youtu.be/2CE_rabuT9A)

- Getaway Points
- Procedural Generation

## Aargh!

Something broke with my editing process this week. I was trying out something new with Lightworks and it didn't really work. Unfortunately fixing this would require a total re-cut of the video which would basically mean no video today :(

I'll try to make sure this doesn't happen again!

## Under The Hood - Procedural Generation Series

This week there is no _under the hood_ section. Don't worry - next week I'll talk about how the procedural generation works internally which is *really* complicated!

Instead, check out my series on procedural generation from a while back:

<ul>
    {% for page in site.tags.procedural-generation-series-tech %}
    <li><a href="{{ post.url }}">{{ page.title }}</a></li>
    {% endfor %}
</ul>
