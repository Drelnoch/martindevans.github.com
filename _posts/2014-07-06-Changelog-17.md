## TL;DR

A changelog is out talking about integrating GOAP and (some of) pathfinding

## This (3) week(s)...

[**Watch The Video!**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-dh23LrNAY)

- Integrating GOAP into the scripting system
- The first NPC (powered by GOAP)
- Pathfinding is half integrated
 - The Pet Rock NPC finds paths, but doesn't use them yet
 - I still need to do more work on making sure paths found are optimal and robust
