## TL;DR

A changelog is out showing off a very basic ragdoll, I'm putting ragdolls on hold for now since they're not important. No updates for 4 weeks because of a holiday.

## This week

[**Watch The Video!**](http://youtu.be/W01M456BK7E)

- Ragdolls sort of work
- Modelling software is complicated

I planned to spend a couple of days getting manually defined ragdolls working this week and then to move on to some small gameplay feature. Unfortunately after I got manually defined ragdolls working (which took the estimated 2 days) I encountered even more unexpected problems which took the rest of the entire week and still aren't fully fixed!

## What's Next?

You know what I'm planning to do next? *NOTHING*.

I'm going to be on holiday in Japan for three and a half weeks and it's going to be glorious - mostly because I won't be crunching on game development every day! To be honest, I'm such a terrible workaholic that I won't be happy if I really do _nothing_ for three weeks so I *will* be programming and I will probably even do some work on Heist - but I'm just going to mess with some far out ideas I have that are unlikely to succeed. Crazy stuff like procedural conversation tree generation or something like that.
