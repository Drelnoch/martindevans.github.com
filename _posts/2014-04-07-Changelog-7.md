## You're Late!

Yes I am, this blog post is coming in a day late. I was pressed for time when I released the video yesterday and didn't have time to write a blog post to go with it. In the future I think I'll start writing the script and the associated blog post on Friday which will give me lots of spare time to get the video out on Saturday or Sunday!
